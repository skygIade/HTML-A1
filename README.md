This is the group project done for CSIT 128 Web Technology Course in the University of Wollongong.

What you see here is mostly my work, with various code referenced from sites like Geek4Geeks, Stack Overflow and W3Schools.

All my groupmate did was add a radio button, a drop down list and created a form. I done everything else.

My work here is not fully functional. Refer to at your own risk.
